Fake Phishing Web-alert Generator

This is a small HTML-based alert generator for your cybersecurity trainings. Nothing fancy.
You can craft a scary looking window with your company URL in a browser URL field to show your employees what malicious pop-up might look like.
Just type in window title, warning, scare text and names for buttons.

Example:
<img width="533" height="493" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d0c40b7-3ad2-4e43-8d58-9a97bec7ea6a" />
